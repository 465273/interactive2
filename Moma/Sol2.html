      Starting from the simple but radical new idea that an artwork's concept is
      more important than its form, Sol LeWitt helped revolutionize the definition
      of art in the 1960s. By the middle of that decade, LeWitt had rejected the
      dominant, psychologically charged abstract style of artmaking for impersonal,
      geometric forms. By repeating and varying a single principle, he created
      sculptural structures that were aesthetically satisfying even as their internal
      logic was pushed to the edge of irrationality.
      LeWitt's procedure of repetition and variance is also the basis for his wall
      drawings. Each of these impermanent artworks consists of a set of the artist's
      instructions, something like a musical score, with the actual execution carried
      out by someone else.
      Over the years, LeWitt's austere compositions gradually became more complex
      and sensuous, though they remained true to his original precepts.
